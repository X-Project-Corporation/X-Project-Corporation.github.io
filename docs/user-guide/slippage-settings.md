# Slippage

Ever wondered why some of your trades get "sandwiched" or fail? Let's master slippage with XSHOT to protect your trades and maximize success.

## Understanding the Battlefield

### What's Really Happening With Your Trades

When you submit a transaction, you enter a high-speed arena where MEV bots are waiting to profit from your trades:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Your Transaction] -->|Pending| B[Mempool]
    B -->|MEV Bot Sees It| C[Front-Running]
    C -->|Higher Gas| D[Bot's Buy]
    D -->|Price Impact| E[Your Buy]
    E -->|Price Drop| F[Bot's Sell]
```

!!! danger "Real World Example"
    Imagine buying a token at $1.00 with 20% slippage:

    1. Bot sees your pending transaction
    2. Buys before you, pushing price to $1.15
    3. Your transaction executes at higher price
    4. Bot sells immediately
    5. You're left holding at a loss

### Chain-Specific Configuration

Each blockchain has its own slippage keyboard, you can configure a button with these values:

=== "Standard Options"

    - 2-5%: Regular tokens
    - 10-15%: Tax tokens
    - 20%: High tax tokens

=== "‚ö†Ô∏è Danger Zone"

    - 49-60%: High risk
    - MEV vulnerable
    - Emergency only

### Configuring Your Protection
