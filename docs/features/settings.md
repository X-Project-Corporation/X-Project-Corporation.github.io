Every great trader customizes their tools. Let's make XSHOT work perfectly for you, one chain at a time.

### 1. Currency Selection

Select your preferred currency for displaying values across XSHOT. This currency will be used for all trade values, balance amounts, and more, making it easy to keep track of your financials in a familiar format.

![Select Currency](../assets/settings/currency.png){ .shadow }

- **Recommended**: USD is a popular choice, but feel free to select any currency you‚Äôre most comfortable with.

### 2. Timezone Configuration

Setting your timezone allows XSHOT to align with your local time, which is crucial for time-based features like automated buy/sell actions and real-time call notifications.

![Select Timezone](../assets/settings/timezone.png){ .shadow }

- **Mobile Tip**: On Telegram, tap **Detect Timezone** and share your location to automatically sync your timezone based on your location.
- **Manual Option**: You can also select your timezone manually by scrolling through the available UTC options.

### 3. Wallet Management

For secure and flexible trading, import any wallet keys you intend to use with XSHOT. Importing as a "new wallet" ensures that existing wallets aren‚Äôt overwritten, helping you keep access to all your funds.

!!! warning "Important: Wallet Safety"
    When importing a wallet, always choose **Add as New** unless you specifically want to replace an existing wallet. Choosing "Replace" can overwrite access to an old wallet, risking loss of funds.

### 4. Favorite Chains

Selecting your favorite chains allows you to access frequently used blockchains directly from the main menu. By choosing your preferred chains, you can quickly switch between them or access them with a single touch on the main screen.

- **Tip**: If no chains are selected, XSHOT provides a single swipe feature to switch between all available chains.
- **Quick Access**: Selected chains appear as quick-access buttons, making it easier to trade on your chosen networks.

# Trading Settings

!!! danger "üö® Critical to Remember"
    Settings are CHAIN-SPECIFIC, not global!

    What you set for ETH won't apply to BASE or SOL.
    Configure each chain separately for your perfect setup.

- Which blockchain you're configuring
- How fast your transactions will execute (gas settings)
- How much you are willing to lose on a transaction (slippage)
